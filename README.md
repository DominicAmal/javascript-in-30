# Javascript in less than 30 words

This projects purpose is to serve as a pre-interview refresher.

It is also my attempt to describe both basic and more advanced Javascript concepts in less than 30 words.

Distilling complex ideas into simple notions is a key tenant of effective communication and I hope this project encourages me and others to practice this skill.

**Contributions are welcome and encouraged.**

A side aim of this project is to allow other junior members of the community to learn how to contribute to open source projects. A goal of the project is to crowdsource the easiest to understand and most accurate definitions of various elements of Javascript.
