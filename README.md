# Javascript in less than 30 words

This project is my attempt to describe both basic and more advanced Javascript concepts in less than 30 words.

Distilling complex ideas into simple notions is a key tenant of effective communication and I hope this project encourages me and others to practice this skill.

Contributions are welcome and encouraged.

A side aim of this project is to allow other junior members of the community to learn how to contribute to open source projects.
